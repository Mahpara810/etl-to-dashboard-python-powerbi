# ETL-to-dashboard-python-powerbi
This project demonstrates a complete workflow from ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) using Python to interactive dashboard creation with Power BI. It showcases how raw data is collected, processed, and visualized to deliver actionable business insights. The project highlights automation, data modeling, and business intelligence best practices.
# ETL to Dashboard: Python & Power BI
This project demonstrates a full-stack data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads data using Python, followed by interactive dashboarding using Power BI. It is designed to bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful business insights, focusing on automation, data quality, and visualization.
#  Objectives
1. Build an automated ETL pipeline using Python.

2. Clean, transform, and load data into a structured format (CSV, database, or Excel).

3. Connect Power BI to the processed data source.

4. Design dashboards to deliver actionable business insights.

5. Demonstrate an end-to-end Data Engineering to BI workflow.
